Timely

The application that will help educators keep track of student information and progress!

This tool helps instructors remember student names and their faces, to prevent any mix up and allows for awareness of any classroom crashers.

Each profile holds the student's progress, e.g. if they are doing poorly in class or if they have too many absences. At a glance, an educator can look at a student's profile and take action if the student needs more help in class or if they are falling behind in class due to too many absences. An instructor can let the student know that they will need tutoring or to drop the class and retake it another time.
On the flip side, educators can also see how well their students are doing in class. Whether the student is doing poorly or doing well, any educator can take action to speak with their students on a one-on-one basis or access their teaching methods and adjust their approach in class, if necessary.

Users are able to create an account, input student information (i.e., create a student profile) and keep track of each student's progress in class.
The application has an easy form to fill out where student information can be entered and submitted.
